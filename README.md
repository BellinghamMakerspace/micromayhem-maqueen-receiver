## Usage

### Setup

Once code has been pushed to micro:bit you will be prompted to set the Bluetooth frequency channel. This channel should match the one set on your [Micromayhem joystick controller](https://github.com/tagnw/micromayhem-joystick-controller).

After that you are off to the races. Use your controller to move the Maqueen around the board as you play.

## Intended use

This code base will be changing rapidly over the next few months as it is intended to be used in conjunction with the [RoboRuckus](https://www.roboruckus.com/) [game server](https://www.roboruckus.com/documentation/setting-up-the-game/).
